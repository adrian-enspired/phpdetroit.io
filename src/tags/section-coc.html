  <h3 class="section-title">Code of Conduct</h3>

  <h4>Purpose</h4>
  <p>A primary goal of the PHPDetroit Conference is to be inclusive to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).</p>
  <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all participants, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>
  <p>We invite all persons who participate in Conference activities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

  <h4>Open Source &amp; Culture Citizenship</h4>
  <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source and culture citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.</p>
  <p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.</p>
  <p><strong>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.</strong></p>

  <h4>Expected Behavior</h4>
  <p>The following behaviors are expected and requested of all participants:</p>

    <li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
    <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
    <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert Conference leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
    <li>Remember that the event venue may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</li>
  </ul>

Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone in possession of a weapon will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without it. Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.</p>

  <h4>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h4>
  <p>Unacceptable behavior from anyone in attendance, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
  <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
  <p>If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the Conference, without warning and without refund.</p>

  <h4>Reporting Guidelines</h4>
  <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us as soon as possible by emailing frank@phpdetroit.io. Please read Reporting Guidelines for details.</p>
  <p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>
  <h4>Addressing Grievances</h4>
  <p>Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the working group, contact the PHPDetroit Conference Board at frank@phpdetroit.io with your appeal and the board will review the case.</p>

  <h4>Scope</h4>
  <p>We expect all participants (paid or unpaid contributors; sponsors; attendees; other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all Conference venues – online and in-person – as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to the Conference.</p>
  <p>This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of Conference activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of participants.</p>
